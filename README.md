Here’s a structured workflow for your web app, including a flowchart breakdown and key technical considerations. I’ll clarify the goals and add details for the marketplace feature:

---

### *Flowchart Overview*
1. *Landing Page*  
   - Header/Footer: Consistent across all pages.  
   - Top Nav Bar: Logo, "Open Location" button, Login/Signup.  
   - Main Buttons:  
     - *Locate Facility*: Redirects to Google Maps API integration (geolocator for recycling/vending machines).  
     - *Start Recycling*: Redirects to category selection.  
     - *Trade Unwanted Devices*: Redirects to marketplace options.  
   - Secondary Links: "About Us" page (static content).  

2. *Location Access*  
   - User clicks "Open Location" → Browser prompts for permission.  
   - If allowed: Auto-fill location data for "Locate Facility" or marketplace features.  
   - If denied: Manual address input.  

3. *Start Recycling Flow*  
   - *Step 1*: Select Category (Small/Large Appliances, ICT Devices).  
   - *Step 2*: Subcategory Selection (e.g., ICT → Phones, Laptops).  
   - *Step 3*: Recycling Instructions (e.g., "Remove battery before disposal").  
   - *Step 4*: Redirect to "Locate Facility" or confirm pickup.  

4. *Trade Unwanted Devices Flow*  
   - *Option 1: C2C Marketplace*  
     - User lists item (title, description, photos, price).  
     - Buyers browse listings → Chat/negotiate → Secure payment (Stripe/PayPal API).  
   - *Option 2: Bulk Sales to Factories*  
     - User selects "Sell in Bulk" → Enter device type/quantity → Get automated quote.  
     - Factory arranges pickup/payment.  
   - *Option 3: Vending Machine Exchange*  
     - User generates QR code (backend API) → Scans at machine → Device verified → Instant payout (TNG/bank API).  

5. *Locate Facility*  
   - Google Maps displays nearby recycling centers/vending machines.  
   - Filter by device type (e.g., "Accepts laptops").

### *Key Technical Considerations*
1. *APIs Required*  
   - *Google Maps*: For geolocation and facility mapping.  
   - *Payment Gateways*: Touch 'n Go (TnG), Stripe, or PayPal for transactions.  
   - *QR Code Generator*: For vending machine verification (e.g., QRCode.js).  
   - *Authentication*: Firebase Auth or Auth0 for user accounts.  

2. *Marketplace Features*  
   - *Price Comparison Engine*: Allow users to see factory vs. C2C prices.  
   - *Bulk Sales Logic*: Algorithm to calculate quotes based on device type/condition.  
   - *Escrow System*: Hold payment until buyer confirms receipt (for C2C safety).  

3. *User Flow Additions*  
   - *Login Wall*: Require signup to list items or initiate trades.  
   - *Device Verification*: For vending machines, integrate a scanning API (e.g., Dynamsoft).  

4. *Design*  
   - Use Figma’s layout for the landing page (ensure mobile responsiveness).  
   - Add a "How It Works" section to explain recycling/trading steps.

     └─▶ Vending Machine (QR Code → Scan → Payment)

### *Notes*  
- For the *vending machine integration*, focus on QR code generation/verification logic (you’ll need a backend to link QR codes to user accounts/payments).  
- The *marketplace* should prioritize simplicity: let users toggle between "Sell to Individuals" (higher effort, higher price) and "Quick Sell to Factories" (lower price, instant quote).  
- Use Angular/React for dynamic category/subcategory rendering.
